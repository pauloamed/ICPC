# Flow, cut and bipartite matching

## Nice reductions

### Edge-disjoint path problem
The number of edge disjoint paths from the source to the sink equals to the max flow from the source to sink setting edge capacities to 1.
If a node can only be part of `k` paths, create a `in` and `out` node for each real node and between these version an edge with capacity `k`.

### Minimum node-cover ~= Maximum matching ~= `N -` (Max independent set) 
It is known that `min_node_cover + max_indep_set = N`  
Also, per KÃ¶nig's theorem, `min_node_cover = maximum matching`.

### General path cover
Find the minimum number of paths in a graph s.t. each node belongs to **at least** one path.  
Solve using maximum bipartite matching. For each node, create to versions `in` and `out`. 
If `x->y \in E`, create an edge in the bipartite matching `out(x)->in(y)`. 
Connect the source to `out` vertices and the sink to `in` vertices.

The maximum matching equals to the minimum path cover (if edge `out(x)->in(y)` is active, it means that the edge `x->y` belongs to a path). 
The number of paths is `n - sz(max_matching)` (since each used edge unites 2 paths).

#### Node-disjoint path cover
Find the minimum number of paths in a graph s.t. each node belongs to **exactly** one path.  
..same as general..  
If `x` reaches `y` (run the transitive closure), create an edge in the bipartite matching `out(x)->in(y)`.  

The maximum matching *~equals* to the minimum path cover node-disjoint (if edge `out(x)->in(y)` is active, it means that there is a path from `x` to `y`). 
The number of paths is `n - sz(max_matching)` (since each used edge unites 2 paths).

### Dilworth's theorem
**Anti-chain of a graph:** Set of nodes s.t. there is no path between them (if seeing graph as an order, set of elements that are not comparable).  
**Chain:** Set of nodes s.t. there is a path between every pair of nodes (if order, every pair is comparable)
**Minimal chain decomposition:** Decompose graph (or order) in edge-disjoint chains, minimizing the number of chains.

The **largest anti-chain** (numer of nodes) has the same size as the **minimal chain decomposition** (number of nodes).
  
The **minimal chain decomposition** is equivalent to the **general path cover**.


## Cut
See cut as a "choice" problem where you have to choose which edges disconnect the source from the sink while minimizing the total cost

## Bipartite matching

### Merging nodes
Suppose a graph with sides A and B for bipartite matching and that the size of A is really small (`<15?`). Nodes from B may be merged if they connect to the same nodes from A. The number of condensed nodes will be at most `2^sz(A)`, what might be smaller than `B`. 

### Hall's theorem on contiguous intervals
Notation:
- `f(S)` is the set of adjacent nodes of `S`
- An `X`-perfect matching (`X` saturation) is a matching which covers every vertex in `X` with an edge
- Hall's: There is a`X`-perfect matching iff for every subset `W` of `X`, `|W| <= |f(W)|`.

We have a bipartite (`L` and `R` sets) matching problem. 
In order to find a `L`-perfect matching, Hall's condition is thus sufficient and necessary.

### Saturating `A` when `A` has `deg(x) >= k` and `B` has `deg(x) <= k`
If we have a bipartite graph `(A,B)` s.t. 
- every `a` in `A` has **at least `k`** edges to `B` and
- every `b` in `B` has **at most `k`** edges to `A`

Then there is `A`-perfect matching  (`A` saturates) if `k >= 1`.

##### Proof (by contradiction)
Suppose that there is a subset that violates Hall.
That is, there is a subset `X` of `A` s.t. `|X| > |f(X)|`.
Define `S = sum_X(deg(x))` and `T = sum_f(X)(deg(x))`.
We have that
- `S >= k|X|`
  - Since every element in `A` has at least `k` edges
- `T <= k|f(X)|`
  - Since every element in `B` has at most `k` edges
- `S <= T`
  - Since
    - every edge of the matching between `X` and `f(X)` belongs to both `X` and `f(X)`
    - every edge from `X` belongs to the matching
    - there may be a edge in `f(X)` not going to `X`
  
Thus, we have that `k|X| <= S <= T <= k|f(X)|`
  
##### (Particular case) `A` has `deg(x) \in 0,1,2` and `B` has `deg(x) <= 2`
We want to know if it is possible to saturate `A`. Note that
- If there is a node `x` s.t. `deg(x) = 0`, it is impossible to saturate `A`
- If there is a node `x` s.t. `deg(x) = 1`, be greedy remove `x` from `A` and `f(x)` and it other edge from `B`

In the end, either there the matching is impossible, or every node `a` from `A` has `deg(a)>=2`.

### Bipartite MaxCMF: edges are suffixes : cost at right side of bipartite
Let's say we have a bipartite graph `(A,B), |A|=|B|=N` and `A_i` can income `in_i` and `B_i` can outcome `out_i` with cost `c_i`.
Edges are `A_i` can send to `B_j`, `j>=i`.  
  
Iterate from `i:0...N` and keep a dict `f[x]`: number of elements w/ cost `x`.  
Elements from `A_i` have to be taken care right now and `B_i` can handle them. Taken all possible elements from `f` w/ `cost < c_i` and assign them to `B_i`, prefer to take elements w/ lower cost.  
Each iteration can remove at most `ON` elements and adds `1` element to `f`. This amortizes to `O(N)` (ignoring the dict cost).  

  
Probably can be extended to `|A| != |B|` if a complete order (line sweep) exists.
