# Geometry

### General observations
- Avoid using floating points (division, square root, trigonometric functions); try to use fractions
- Avoid doing too much comparisons w/ floating points
- Avoid using floating points with big magnitude. This implies a greater error.

##### *Catastrophic cancelletion*
Assume that the relative error is `10^-6`. 
Lets say we cancel out `A=10^6` and `B=10^6`, their erros are `10^0`. `A-B` is now `10^0` with error `10^0`.
We don't want this to happen.

### Manhattan to Chebyshev distante
Chebyshev distance: `D(X,Y)=max(|X_i-Y_i|)`  
The Manhattan distance between points `X` and `Y` is "equivalent" to the Chebyshev distance between `X'` and `Y'`, where `P'` is the expansion of the abs for a point (all `2^(d-1)` combinations of signals. One coordinate can be fixed since we are taking the abs). Ex:
- `(x,y)` => `(x+y,x-y)`
- `(x,y,z)` => `(x+y+z,x+y-z,x-y+z,x-y-z)`

### Side of polygon
A polygon has every side smaller ~or equal~ to the sum of all other sides.

### 3 colinear points
For each point `p`, do polar sort of all the points using `p` as center. If there are colinear points, there will be adjacent in this sorting.

### Perimeter and area of convex polygons
- Given a fixed perimeter, approximating the polygon to a circle will maximize its area
- Given fixed edge lenghts, the area of a polygon determined by such edges will be maximized when inscribed on a circle
- Bretschneider's formula:
```
area_of_quadrilateral = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-abcd*cos^2((â+ĉ)/2))
s: semiperimeter
â and ĉ: any opposite angles

- The quadrilateral can be both convex or concave, but it mustn't cross itself
- If `d=0`, this is a triangle (Heron's formula)
- A convex quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic iff its opposite angles are equal `180deg` => `cos(...) = 0` (Brahmagupta's formula)
```
### Helly's theorem
Let `C` be a finite family of convex polygons in `R^n` such that, for `k ≤ n + 1`, any `k` members of `C` have a nonempty intersection. 
Then the intersection of all members of `C` is nonempty.
Eg.: In the plane (2d), if, for every triple (3) of convex polygons, there is a non-empty intersection, the intersention of all polygons is non-empty.

### Pick's theorem
Let `P` be a polygon with integer coordinates for its vertices.
Let:
```
- A: Area of P
- i: #integer points inside the polygon
- b: #integer points in the polygon boundaries
Then, A = i + (b/2) - 1
```

### Convex closures
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15456-s10/ClassNotes/lecture2.pdf)  
A convex combination of a set of points is a linear combination that is both non-negative and affine i.e. a weighted sum of such points s.t. their coefficients sum up to 1 and all are >= 0.
- The convex closure of a point is the point itself. 
- The convex closure of two points is the line segment between them. 
- The convex closure of a set of points in the plane is a convex polygon.
With this, we know that a point is inside a polygon iff it can be represented as a convex combination of some of its vectors (which can be the polygon's vertixes).
Also, a polygon can be seen as an infinite set of vectors.

### Minkoviski sum
Definition: `A ^ B = {a + b | a \in A, b \in B}`

Properties:
- `A ^ NULL = A`
- `A ^ {v} = {a + v | a \in A} (translating)`
- `A ^ {0} = A`
- `A ^ B = B ^ A`
- `(A ^ B) ^ C = A ^ (B ^ C)`
- `c(A ^ B) = cA ^ cB (scaling)`
- `A /\ B != NULL` iff `0` is inside `A-B`.
  - If `0` lies on a (non-deg) vertice of `A-B`, `A /\ B` is a point
  - If `0` lies on an edge of `A-B`, `A /\ B` is a segment
  - If `0` lies on inside `A-B`, `A /\ B` is a polygon
  - `0` is inside `A-B` iff exists `a \in A` and `b \in B` s.t. `a = b <=> a - b = 0`. Since the image of `a - b` equals `A-B`, `0 \in A-B`.
- `argmin_v((A + {v}) /\ B = NULL) = argmin_v(0 \not_in A-B+{v})`
